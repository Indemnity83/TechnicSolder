Solder helps you lower bandwidth usage, keep old versions of your modpack available to users and provides faster, streamlined updates. You won't know how you managed a modpack before you used Solder.

## Installing / Getting started

If you're interested in running your own version of the software then getting setup is still pretty straight forward.

```shell
composer create-project indemnity83/TechnicSolder
```

When you run the above command, composer will clone the current version of TechnicSolder, install all the required dependencies and launch the installer script which will step you through configuring the application for its first use.
